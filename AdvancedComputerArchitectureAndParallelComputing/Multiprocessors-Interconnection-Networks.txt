MULTIPROCESSORS INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS
---------------------------------------------

Two schemes are introduced, namely static and dynamic interconnection networks.
Static networks form all connections when the system is designed rather than
when the connection is needed. In a static network, messages must be routed
along established links. Dynamic interconnection networks establish connections
between two or more nodes on othe fly as messages are routed along the links.

Interconnection Networks Taxonomy
----------------------------------
Static networks can be further classified according to their interconnection 
pattern as one-dimension (1D), two-dimension (2D), or hypercube (HC).

Dynamic networks can be classified based on interconnection scheme as bus-based
versus switch-based. Bus-based networks can further be classified as single bus
or multiple buses.
Switch based dynamic networks can be classified according to the structure of
the interconnection network as single-stage (SS), multistage (MS), or crossbar
networks.

BUS-BASED DYNAMIC INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS
---------------------------------------------

Single Bus Systems
-------------------
Such a system consists of N processors, each having its own cache, connected by
a shared bus. The use of local caches reduces the processor - memory traffic.
All processors communicate with a single shared memroy.
The typical size of such a system varies between 2 and 50 processors.
The actual size is determined by the traffic per processor and the bus 
bandwidth (defined as the maximum rate at which the bus can propagate data 
once transmission has started).
The single bus network complexity, measured in terms of the number of buses
used, is O(1), while the time complexity, measured in terms of the amount
of input to output delay is O(N).

Although simple and easy to expand, single bus multiprocessors are inherently
limied by the bandwidth of the bus and the fact that only one processor can
access the bus, and in turn only one memory access can take place at any given
time.
