 A little PowerShell History
 ---------------------------



PowerShell is a Microsoft framework that includes a command shell
and a scripting language. PowerShell has traditionally been used
by system administrators, IT teams, incident response groups,
and forensic investigators to gain access to operational 
information regarding the infrastructure they manage.


How is PowerShell Used Today?
---------------------------------

PowerShell is most typically used to automate administrative tasks
and examin the details of runningg desktops, servers, and mobile
devices. It is used to examine both locan and remote systems using
the Common Object Model (COM) and the Windows Management Interface
(WMI). Today, it can be used to examine and maange remote Linux,
Mac, and Network devices using the Common Information Model (CIM).


NOTE: You can run PowerShell and PowerShell ISE with User
privlege; however, to gain acces to many of the rich acquisition
functions needed, runningi PowerShell as Administrator is requried. A world of caution as well. Running as Administrator or User
and executing CmdLets can damage your system or delete important
files! Proceed with caution!

PowerShell ISE interface
-------------------------

1. Scripting Panel: This panel provides the ability to create
PowerShell scripts that incorporate multiple commands using the 
included PowerShell scripting language. Note that this is not
where we typically start when developing PowerShell Scripts. 
Rather, we experiment in the Direct Command Entry Panel first,
then once we have perfected our approach, we can then create
scripts.

2. Direct Command Entry Panel: This panel is used to execute 
PowerShell CmdLets. The commands entered here are much more powerful then the anscestor Windows Command Line or DOS commands.
In addition, the format and structure of these commands is much
different and follows some strict rules. I will be explaning the
verb-noun format and structure and providing more details and
some examples in the next section.

3. Command Help Panel: This panel provides detailed help and 
information regarding every CmdLet available to us. However, 
I rarely use this area and instead request direct help using the 
Get-Help CmdLet to get information regarding CmdLets of interest.

What Is a CmdLet?
--------------------------

A CmdLet is typically a lightweight Windows PowerShell script that
performs a specific function.

A CmdLet then is a specific order from a user to the operating
system, or to an application to perform a service, such as 
"display all the currently running processes" or "show me all 
the services that are currently stoppped."

All CmdLets are expressed as a verb-noun pair and have a help file
that can be accessed using the verb-noun pair Get-Help <CmdLet name>. So yes, even help is just another CmdLet. Updating help is 
vital to keep help associated with curent all the currently
installed CmdLets and to install help for new CmdLets that
are created and updated every day.

The help files will be updated for all installed modules. We will
For now this will update all the standard PowerShell modules.
Additional modules each as Active Directory, VMWare, SharePoint,
and hundreds of others allow acquisition to numerous devices and
services.
