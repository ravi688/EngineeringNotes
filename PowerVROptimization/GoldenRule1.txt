 Golden Rule 1: Do Understand the Target Device
 -----------------------------------------------

 The first rule is about understanding the device you are developing for.

 In the past we have known two devices with similar graphics cores, similar CPUs, and even similar
 memory specifications, but very different performance. This means you cannot really make any
 assumptions about your target device. Real tests need to be performed on them in order to gain a 
 feeling of how they behave and what parts of the SoC are more likely to cause performance 
 bottlenecks. Testing can help evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of a device.

 As we've mentioned before, do not assume the graphics core is the problem. Other parts of the
 system including the graphics driver and CPU can cause issues.

 One of the most important factors in determining performance is the amount of memory bandwidth.
 This isn't readily available information and therefore requires testing in order to be 
 determined accurately.
