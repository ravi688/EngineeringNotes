 Golden Rule3 : Do not use alpha blend unnecessarily
 ------------------------------------------------------

 The third rule is to disable alpha blending wherever possible. If transparent objects are required,
 keep the number of transparent objects to a minimum. The reasoning behind this is that deferred
 renderers, such as PowerVR graphics cores, calculate the visibility of fragments before the 
 corresponding fragment shader is invoked to process it. This prevents invisible fragmments in 
 output image being processed unnecessarily.

 If alph blending is enabled, then the hardware used to determine a fragment's visibility cannot be
 used. This is because the occluded (alpha-blended) fragment may impact the final rendererd image.
 Due to this behaviour, enabling alpha blending eliminates the benefits of deferred rendering
 graphics architectures. This means the hardware is no longer able to make decisions about a 
 fragment's visibility and drop it from the pipeline. This will likely result in overdraw which is
 where fragments are being processed that are not actually visible in the final image. Overdraw
 can negatively impact the application's performance, particularly if the application is already
 limited by rendering.
