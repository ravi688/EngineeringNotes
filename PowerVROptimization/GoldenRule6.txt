 Golden Rule 6: Do use texture compression
 -----------------------------------------

 The sixth rule is to use texture compression. In some instances, it is worth considering the 
 balance between texture size and texture compression. It may be possible to use a larger texture
 and a low-bitrate compression scheme and achieve a better balance of bandwidth savings and 
 acceptable image quality.

 Texture compression, not to be confused with image file compression, minises the runtime memory
 footprint of textures. This provides several performance benefits, but primarily reduces the 
 amount of system memory bandwidth consumed sending data to the graphics core.

 PVRTC and PVRTCII are PowerVR specific compression technologies and will achieve best peformance
 on the hardware, consumiong as little as 2 bits per pixel. These textures are also very texture
 cache efficient as the lower pixel size allows more pixels to fit in the limited amount of cache
 memory available to the texture units.

 Depending on the PowerVR generation and graphics API targeted, additional compressed texture
 formats may be supported, such as ASTC.
