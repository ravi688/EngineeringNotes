 Golden Rule 8: Do not use Discard
 -----------------------------------

 The eight rule is to avoid the use of discard. Applications should not use the discard operation 
 in the fragment shader as using it will not improve performance. Most mobile graphics cores use
 a form of tile based deferred rendering (TBDR) and using discard negates some of the benefits of
 this type of architecture. If possible, an application should prefer alpha blending over discarding.

 Applications should also avoid alpha testing. When an alpha-testing primitive is submitted, early
 depth testing, such PowerVR's Hidden Surface Removal (HSR), can discard fragments that are occluded
 by other fragments closer to the camera. Unlike opaque primitives which would also perform depth
 writes at this pipeline stage, alpha-tested primitives cannot write data to the depth buffer until
 the fragment shader has executed and fragment visibility is known. These deferred depth writes can
 impact performance, as subsequent primitives cannot be processed until the depth buffers are updated
 with alpha tested primitive's values.

 For optimal performance, consider alph blending instead of alpha test to avoid costly deferred
 depth write operations. To ensure HSR removes as much overdraw as possile, submit draws in the 
 following order:

 1. Opaque
 2. Alpha-tested
 3. Blended
