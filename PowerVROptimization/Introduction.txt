 Golden Rules of Graphics Development > Introduction
 --------------------------------------------------

 Welcome to the Golden Rules of Development training presentation.

 This training will be focused on the Golden Rules of graphics development. These are various rules
 of thumb and bits of wisdom which you can use when developing graphics applications for 
 Imagination GPU devices. They're derived from the combined experience of Developer Technology team
 here at Imagination.

 Some of these recommendations are specific to Imagination GPUs, but, in general, most are simply
 good practice for any mobile graphics developer.

 The next set of slides will cover the 10 key rules adopted by the Graphics Developer Technology
 team, which closely relate to some common performance bottlenecks.

 These bottlenecks may seem obvious, but when working with developers, we've found the same mistakes
 being made fairly often.
