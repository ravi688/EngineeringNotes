 INTRODUCTION
 ----------------

 This lecture presents a thorough study of the microarchitecture of contemporary microprocessors.
 The focus is on implementation aspects, with discussions on alternative approaches and their
 implications in terms of performance, power and cost.

 The microarchitecture of processors has undergone a continuous evolution. For instance, Intel has
 shipped a new microprocessor approximately every year in the recent past. This evolution is fueled
 mainly by two types of factors: (1) technology scaling and (2) workload evolution.

 Technology scaling often is referred to as Moore's law, which basically states that transistor
 density doubles approximately every 2 years. Every technology generation provides transistors
 that are smaller, faster and less energy consuming. This allows designers to increase the 
 performance of processors, even without increasing their area and power.

 On the other hand, processors adapt their features to better exploit the characteristics of user
 applications, which evolve over time. For instance in recent years, we have witnesses an 
 extraordinary increase in the use of multimedia applications, which have resulted in an increasing
 number of features in the processors to better support them.

 Classification of Microarchitectures
 ------------------------------------
 
 1. Pipelined/Nonpipelined Processors (Pipelining increases instruction level parallelism ILP)
 2. In-Order/Out-of-Order Processors
  	Out of order processors require more complex hardware than in-order ones.
 3. Scalar/Superscalar processors
 	a scalar processor cannot achieve a throughput greater than 1 instruction per cycle for
	any code.
	Note that a superscalar processor can execute more than 1 instruction at the same time in 
	all pipeline stages and therefore can achieve a throughput higher than 1 instruction per
	cycle for some codes.

 4. Vector Processors
  	most microprocessors include a rich set of instructions that operate on relatively small
	vectors (e.g., up to 8 singl-precision FP elements in the Intel AVX extensions).
	These instructions are often referred to as SIMD (single instruction , multiple data)
	instructions.
	According to this definition, many processors nowadays are vector processors, although
	their support for vector instructions varies significantly among them.

 5. Multicore Processors
 	A core is a unit that can process a sequential piece of code (usually referred to as a 
	thread)

 6. Multithreaded Processors
 	A multithreaded processors is a processor that can execute simulatneously more than one
	thread on some of its cores. Notes that both multicore and multithreaded processors
	can execute multiple threads simultaneously, but the key distinguising feature is that
	the threads use mostly different hardware resources in the case of a multicore, 
	whereas they share most of the hardware resources in a multithreaded processor.

	Multicore and multithreading are two orthogonal concepts, so they can be used
	simultaneously. For instance, the Intel Core i7 processor has multiple cores, and each
	core is a two-way multithreaded.
